# **Welcome to the repo for Virtuoso**

Virtuoso the program designed to take the pain away from recording midi files. The latest update is currently capable of loading a midi file, and playing it from beginning to end. It will graphically show which keys are being pressed, although it currently does not display unique colors depending on the layer. Also, it can only play sound using a square wave, but I will get it setup to load samples in a future update.
