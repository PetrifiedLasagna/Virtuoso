# **Welcome to the repo for Virtuoso**

Virtuoso the program designed to take the pain away from recording midi files. This is currently in the Alpha testing phase, so if you want to help out go visit the live demo and see if it can load your midi without any problems. You'll know it worked, because there will not be any red highlighted text at the end of all the text that it spits out.
